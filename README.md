zf2-poker-unittest
=======================

A simple database with online poker players, created with Zend framework 2 and based on the ZendSkeletonApplication (availalbe on git), and some unit tests added.

------------
This is mostly for reviewing and cannot be run directly since the Zend Framework 2 is required and is not included here but excluded by the gitignore.

------------
The unit tests are in folder:
[module/Player/test/PlayerTest](module/Player/test/PlayerTest)
